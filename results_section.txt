### 4.1 Model Performance Overview

The drought prediction framework was evaluated across multiple meteorological stations and SPI accumulation periods using seven different machine learning models. The comprehensive evaluation involved 168 individual model configurations (7 models × 6 SPI timescales × 4 stations) tested on data from 1985-2019 with forecasting extending to 2099.

### 4.2 Comparative Model Performance

Table 1 presents the performance metrics for all models across different SPI timescales, averaged across all stations. The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model demonstrated superior performance, particularly for short-term drought indices (SPI-1 and SPI-3), achieving correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99 and RMSE values below 0.15 for SPI-1 predictions.
