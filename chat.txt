I have a CSV containing 13 stations' monthly rainfall data and calculated normalized spi1,3,6,9,12,24 that range from 1990 to 2024 
write a perfect code to predict drought using these  5 models: 
extra TF, random forest, svr, lstm,wblstm 

I think this approach is good but please correct me if I'm wrong: 
use covariate 
remove seasonality

compute metrics by comparing validations with predictions

select the best model for each station and timescale 

using the best model forecast to today
